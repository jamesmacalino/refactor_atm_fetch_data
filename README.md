# Pulling Data Using Fetch and Refactoring ATM Code

## The objective of this exercise was to practice getting data from the MIT Hacker News remote data source

### In the first step of this activity I added code that fetched the Hacker News data, 
as well as added new styles to the list of articles. Then, in the second step, I added 
client-side pagination to display data on multiple pages.
